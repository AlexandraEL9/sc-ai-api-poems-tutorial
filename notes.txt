--------------------------------------------------- Lesson 2: What is AI?
Machine Learning
Neural Networks

How to USE ai and communicate with it rather than understanding AI as a whole.

Bunch of computers/ layers trained using data
computer sent data and then tries to categorise/ sort etc
reasoning engine

uses natural language (not computer based language)
KEY- learning how to communicate well with ai to get best results.

can provide text- some models can provide images/ videos ect.

Learn how to talk to ai     
    and connect api 


--------------------------------------------------- Lesson 3: Prompt Engineering
Prompts- How we talk to ai/ ai models
         Basically a programming language we cam use to communicate with ai
                however- it is a 'natural language'

AI would like prompts that are well designed

Be kind and positive to the AI

Prompt engineering- how to write good prompts for ai

GOOD Prompts

-give some context to the ai
- tell what the ai model is (tell the ai what you expect it to be)   
                           "You are am opinionated AI assisstant who has a lot of knowledge about food/ gastronomy
                           and has travelled all over the world. Please provide what you think would be the best 
                           cuisine in the world" 
be polite- add positive reinforcement
                             "that's nice, thanks for your answers. But please be more precise and provide one 
                             cuisine only"
be clear what you want and in what format
                             "thanks- now provide your answer in a simple and concise way in html format"

clear, concise, relevant background, positive reinforcement, feedback, use specific key words.

-------------------Challenge
Write the prompt for an AI asking what the best country to visit right now is.

Context:
Prompt:

answer
                  "You are an opinionated AI assisstant who has a lot of knowledge about travel and culture and 
                  has travelled all over the world. Please provide what you think would be the best place to 
                  travel to in the world right now"

                  ai answered Japan and gave detailed feedback for answer

Challenge solution
This is a suggested solution, not "the" only solution.

note/ example
https://api.shecodes.io/ai/v1/generate?prompt={prompt}&context={context}&key={key}

PARAMETERS
prompt- required- The AI prompt (example: What is the capital city of Portugal)
key- required- your api key: 06a59897dof9572ebabb740ftb4354ba
context- optional- The AI assistant context (example: Make sure to provide a clear and precise answer)

EXAMPLE

EX- api call
Get the author of Harry Potter books
https://api.shecodes.io/ai/v1/generate?prompt=who is the author of all Harry Potter books&context=
please be precise&key=06a59897dof9572ebabb740ftb4354ba

ex- responses
{
  "prompt": "who is the author of all Harry Potter books",
  "context": "please be precise",
  "answer": "The author of all the Harry Potter books is J.K. Rowling."
}

BUILD
create api key variable
let apiKey = "06a59897dof9572ebabb740ftb4354ba";

create api url variable
let apiUrl = `https://api.shecodes.io/ai/v1/generate?prompt=${prompt}&context=${context}&key=${apiKey}`;

create variable for context
let context =
    "be polite and provide a very short answer. make sure to pick one";

create variable for prompt
 let prompt = "what's the best cuisine in the world?";

add axios
axios.get(apiUrl).then(showAnswer);
in html head <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.6.7/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

create showAnswer function
function showAnswer(response) {
    alert(response.data.answer);
  }


COMPLETED JavaScript
function showAnswer(response) {
    alert(response.data.answer);
  }
  
  let apiKey = "06a59897dof9572ebabb740ftb4354ba";
  let context =
    "be polite and provide a very short answer. make sure to pick one";
  let prompt = "what's the best cuisine in the world?";
  let apiUrl = `https://api.shecodes.io/ai/v1/generate?prompt=${prompt}&context=${context}&key=${apiKey}`;
  console.log("Processing")
  axios.get(apiUrl).then(showAnswer);

--------------------------------------------------- Lesson 6: CSS in JavaScript
play with html and css from JavaScript
not used often but for specific issues / contexts

  function handleClick() {
    alert("hooray");
  }
  let buttonElement = document.querySelector("#special-button");
  buttonElement.addEventListener("click", handleClick);


  - use attributes.
  js has access to html attributes     eg buttonElement
          console.log(buttonElelment.attributes.id);

    attrubute of an element is anything inside of an element's opening tag-   id/ class/ type=""   etc

can use js to set attributes using setAttributs
           console.log(buttonElement.setAttribute("class", "warning"));

WHY? might need to disable a button when something specific button

---class list and style

              buttonElement.style.color = "red";

              heading.classList.add("highlight");
              heading.classList.remove("highlight");
              heading.classList.toggle("highlight");

usage- hide and element

              heading.style.display = "none";
              or
              heading.classList.add("hidden")
                    then in css
                         .hidden {
                          display: none;
                         }


use camelCase not dash eg not border-radius becomes borderRadius

3 ways-
   use attributes (not used often)

   use innerHTML

   use setAttribute

   use element.style.__=     ;

   use element.classlist.add/remove/toggle("classlist name");
SNIPPETS

-HTML attributes manipulation
let button = document.querySelector("input#button");
button.setAttribute("disabled", "disabled");

let email = document.querySelector("input#email");
email.removeAttribute("required");

-CSS styles
let boxElement = document.querySelector("#box");
boxElement.style.backgound = "red";
boxElement.style.padding = "10px 20px";
boxElement.style.marginRight = "10px";

-HTML classes
let li = document.querySelector("li#special");
li.classList.remove("liked");
li.classList.add("something");


--------------------------------------------------- Lesson 7: JavaScript plugins
js plugins- are libraries/ sourcecode so don't have to reinvent wheel.
use saringly/ juciciously- only when needed.

eg- typewritier animantion
let heading = document.querySelector("h1");

new Typewriter('h1', {
  strings: "Hello World",
  autoStart: true,
});

stop deletion- make a string with "" instead of an array []
