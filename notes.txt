Machine Learning
Neural Networks

How to USE ai and communicate with it rather than understanding AI as a whole.

Bunch of computers/ layers trained using data
computer sent data and then tries to categorise/ sort etc
reasoning engine

uses natural language (not computer based language)
KEY- learning how to communicate well with ai to get best results.

can provide text- some models can provide images/ videos ect.

Learn how to talk to ai     
    and connect api 


--------------------------------------------------- Lesson 3: Prompt Engineering
Prompts- How we talk to ai/ ai models
         Basically a programming language we cam use to communicate with ai
                however- it is a 'natural language'

AI would like prompts that are well designed

Be kind and positive to the AI

Prompt engineering- how to write good prompts for ai

GOOD Prompts

-give some context to the ai
- tell what the ai model is (tell the ai what you expect it to be)   
                           "You are am opinionated AI assisstant who has a lot of knowledge about food/ gastronomy
                           and has travelled all over the world. Please provide what you think would be the best 
                           cuisine in the world" 
be polite- add positive reinforcement
                             "that's nice, thanks for your answers. But please be more precise and provide one 
                             cuisine only"
be clear what you want and in what format
                             "thanks- now provide your answer in a simple and concise way in html format"

clear, concise, relevant background, positive reinforcement, feedback, use specific key words.
